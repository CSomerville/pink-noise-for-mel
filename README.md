# Pink Noise For Mel

### Performance art software using the web audio api.

pink-noise-for-mel is a performance tool for the poet Mel Nichols. As she reads from her project, *Pink Noise*, she modulates the amount by which her microphone input is obscured by pseudo-random spikes and troughs in the visible waveform. Known for its eerily synthetic evocation of the sound of rushing water or rustling leaves, the interplay or overlay of pink noise with or on the human voice suggests the terrifyingly lovely dumb revenge of nature's impartiality. As of this writing, only Firefox and Chrome support microphone access.
